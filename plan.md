# Zone Selector Library - Development Plan

## Overview
Building a TypeScript frontend library for interactive geographic zone selection using Paper.js for vector graphics rendering. The library provides an interactive canvas-based interface for selecting geographic zones with support for multiple data types and categories.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Set up TypeScript project structure
- [x] Configure build tools (Vite/Rollup) 
- [x] Set up testing framework (Jest/Vitest)
- [x] Create basic Zone interface and types
- [x] Implement category management system

## Phase 2: Paper.js Integration âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Integrate Paper.js for vector rendering
- [x] Create ZoneSelector class with canvas target configuration
- [x] Implement coordinate system conversion (geo â†’ canvas)
- [x] Set up Paper.js project scope management
- [x] Basic zone shape rendering (polygons/circles)
- [x] Fixed Paper.js import issues (global scope setup)

## Phase 3: Selection Logic âœ… COMPLETED  
- [x] Implement zone click detection using Paper.js hit testing
- [x] Add zone selection/deselection with visual feedback
- [x] Category switching with selection persistence
- [x] Selection state management
- [x] Event callbacks for selection changes
- [ ] Click and drag multi-selection using Paper.js paths

## Phase 4: Data Integration & Demo âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create interactive demo application
- [x] Integrate real geographic data sources
- [x] Support for multiple data formats (H3, GeoSure, administrative boundaries)
- [x] Comprehensive H3 hexagon coverage at multiple precision levels (3-8)
- [x] UK country boundaries as administrative regions
- [x] Viewport bounds abstraction for flexible geographic focus
- [x] Category system with H3 precision levels and region types

## Phase 5: Advanced Features ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Click and drag multi-selection using Paper.js paths
- [ ] Performance optimization (viewport culling, shape simplification)
- [ ] Responsive canvas sizing and zoom/pan controls
- [ ] Voronoi diagram generation for point zones
- [ ] Territory boundary creation using Paper.js paths

## Phase 6: Library Packaging ðŸŽ¯ PENDING
- [ ] Bundle optimization (tree-shakeable)
- [ ] Type definitions export
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] NPM package preparation
- [ ] Unit test coverage

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Graphics**: Paper.js (vector graphics, canvas rendering)
- **Build**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Geometry**: Turf.js for geographic operations
- **Bundle**: ESM + CommonJS outputs

## Key Design Decisions
- Framework-agnostic vanilla TypeScript
- Canvas-based rendering via Paper.js
- Flexible target specification (user provides canvas element)
- Minimal dependencies beyond Paper.js
- Event-driven architecture
- Strong TypeScript support

## Library API Design
```typescript
const selector = new ZoneSelector({
  canvas: document.getElementById('map-canvas'),
  zones: zonesData,
  onSelectionChange: (selectedZones) => { /* callback */ }
});
```
