Zone Selector Library - Phase 1
Wireframe playground
What This Is
An interactive map tool that lets users select geographic areas (zones) for analysis or processing. Think of it like selecting files in a file browser, but for geographic regions on a map.
The Problem It Solves
You have geographic data divided into different categories (like "sales territories", "delivery zones", "voting districts") and you need users to be able to:
View one category at a time
Select specific zones from that category
Get back a list of which zones were chosen in all the categories
How It Works
The Map Interface
Users see a world map with colored regions drawn on it. Each region represents a "zone" - this could be anything from a country, to a sales territory, to a delivery area.
Category Selection
At any time, users can only see zones from one category. A set of radio buttons lets them switch between categories like:
Sales Territories
Delivery Zones ‚Üê currently selected
Marketing Regions
Zone Selection
Users click on zones to select them:
Unselected zones appear as outlined shapes
Selected zones are filled in with color
A list shows the names of all selected zones
Smart Interactions
Click and drag: Instead of clicking each zone individually, users can drag across multiple zones to select/deselect them all at once
Category memory: If you select some zones, then switch categories, your previous selections stay visible on the map until you deselect them
Special Zone Types
Some zones might be defined by just a single point (like "closest store to this address"). The tool automatically creates territorial boundaries around these points using mathematical techniques (Voronoi diagrams).

interface Zone {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  geometry: {
    type: 'Point' | 'Polygon';
    coordinates: number[] | number[][];  // Geographic coordinates
  };
  selected: bool;
}


What You Get Back
The library tells you which zones the user has selected, so your application can process that geographic data however it needs to. The return state/callback is a list of selected zones.


State/Setup params:
{
    zones: Zone[];
    categories: calculated/memoised from zones;
    currentCategory: Category;
    
}
